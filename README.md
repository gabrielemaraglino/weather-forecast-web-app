# üå§Ô∏è Weather Forecast Web Application

This project is a simple web application built using Streamlit that provides weather forecasts for any city over a range of 1 to 5 days. The data is fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API and displayed in an easy-to-use interface. Users can choose between viewing temperature trends or sky conditions (like clouds, rain, etc.).

The application is **deployed** and available at: [Weather Forecast App](https://weather-forecast-web-app-cdrjywnmgw4hpfttu7edc4.streamlit.app/), hosted on **Streamlit Cloud**.

## Features
- Get weather forecasts for any location.
- Choose between 1 to 5 days of weather forecasting.
- View temperature trends with interactive line charts.
- View sky conditions (Clear, Clouds, Rain, Snow) with corresponding images.
